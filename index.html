        mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone,

        I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
        and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.

        When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and
        <em style="background-color: cyan"

          foliage of my trees,</em

        <br />
        and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary exquisite
        sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
